      "content": "Rationality is the pursuit of clarity in thought — asking not only what we believe, but why we believe it. At its heart lies the fundamental question: how do we know what we know? This inquiry opens the door to epistemology, the study of knowledge, and to the age-old search for certainty in a world of competing claims.\nIn exploring rationality, we encounter the theories of truth: the correspondence view, where truth aligns with reality; the coherence view, where truth rests in consistency within a system of beliefs; the pragmatic view, where truth proves itself in practice; and others that wrestle with the tension between appearance and reality. By examining these theories, rationality challenges us to test our assumptions, weigh our reasoning, and refine our understanding of the world.\nTo be rational is not to dismiss faith, intuition, or tradition, but to hold every claim — whether scientific, philosophical, or theological — to the light of reason, evidence, and reflection. It is an ongoing dialogue between mind and reality, aimed not at final answers but at deeper wisdom.",
